This zip file contains the single-page HTML version of release 25 of
the Life Lexicon, a lexicon of terms used in Conway's Game of Life.

The files herein are:

  README        (this file)
  lexicon.htm   (the no-frames HTML version of the Lexicon)
  lexiconf.htm  (the frames version of the Lexicon)
  buttons.htm   (top bar for the frames version)
  lifelex.css   (the stylesheet)

Note that on some browsers (e.g., Netscape 6.01) the frames version is
incredibly slow.  If you do not want to use the frames version, then
lexiconf.htm and buttons.htm can be deleted.
